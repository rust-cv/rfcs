# rust-cv rfs 

This repo is to submit RFCs (Request For Comments) for parts of the rust 
computer vision ecosystem. This unofficial working group aims to create
foundation crates and types useful for computer vision applications in a wide
variety of domains, and part of doing this means considering how applicable the
design is to a variety of applications.

This is very much an early stage thing so there is no firm process. But check
the rfcs folder to see a template for an RFC and if there's something in the
ecosystem you want feel free to fill in the template and raise a PR.

Hopefully, from each RFC a clear design that is both ergonomic and powerful
will emerge and we'll see compuer vision in Rust grow to something truly 
wonderful to use.

# Summary

Put a brief summary of the aim of this RFC and what it aims to do. Think of
this as akin to an abstract in academic writing.

# Prior Art

Think of this like a literature review, attempt to look at what libraries or
approaches exist in other areas i.e. in OpenCV, OpenMVG, Matlab, dlib, PIL.
We can always learn from what's been done before and here we can think of:

1. What's good about existing approaches
2. What's not so good (potential API misuse etc)
3. Where is this unidiomatic or unergonomic for Rust

# Use case

What are the use cases for this?

# Design

Optional. Sometimes it's good to just scout around on what prior art and use
cases for something is. Often we'll need user feedback before we start to think
of a design.

But if you're here start to discuss how a design would look in Rust. Feel free
to have multiple subsections if there are different approaches possible - it can
give more to discuss. Also, think about how the API will look from a user
perspective both for the common and less-common usecases. 

Additionally, think about expansion. Often other domains may have other needs
and need to add extra functionality. Does this design make that easy or impede
it in any way? Will this cause the functionality to be reimplemented or hinder
adoption?

# Impact

Optional section, would creation of this cause rework to anything existing or
potentially deprecate something? Will it solve painpoints already in the
ecosystem?

# Unresolved Questions

What questions or uncertainities are there about this design? Are there any
known unknowns or potential areas it might fall flat?
